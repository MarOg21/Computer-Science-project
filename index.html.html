I am very passionate for tech, and I enjoy coding and building projects which involves vast creativity. i formerly worked as an intern in a tech company in Nigeria and by working there i was able to hone my skills in the field of tech but now i am in Germany, i am looking for an internship to also further my experiences in my field of study. i am a very determined and hardworking student, who strives to achieve positive goals in life and I am interested in software engineering beacuse it teaches alot about problem solving with creativity and non stop learning. and it has a huge real world apllication and that's what makes it much more rewarding. I have one of my python project added to my websites, it is a weather dashboard for Berlin, you can find it below.</p>
